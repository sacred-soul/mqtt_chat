# MQTT Broadcast Messenger

This project is a **Broadcast messenger using  MQTT commnunication protocol**, which can used as reference for learning MQTT in **C**. This can be modified to create full duplex messengers using MQTT. Her we have used localhost(127.0.0.1) for virtual conversation. So you can  subscribe and publish using same device.

Makefile is included and exectution can be done using commands, **./sub_app** and then **./pub_app** *(on seperate terminal tabs)*. 

If you have not installed Mosquitto library, run *sudo apt install mosquitto & sudo apt install mosquitto-clients* on terminal.

Sorry for the flaws.. (eg space cant be added inside message)
